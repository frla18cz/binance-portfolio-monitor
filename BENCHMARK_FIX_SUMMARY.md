# Benchmark System Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with benchmark calculation and independence to ensure benchmark operates as a true passive 50/50 BTC/ETH comparison portfolio.

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Benchmark Independence (api/index.py)
- **Problem**: Rebalancing was using portfolio NAV instead of benchmark value
- **Solution**: Changed rebalancing to use `current_benchmark_value`
- **Result**: Benchmark now evolves independently based on market prices

### 2. Added Rebalancing Validation (api/index.py)
- **Added**: 1% tolerance check to ensure rebalancing preserves value
- **Purpose**: Catch calculation errors and protect data integrity
- **Behavior**: Raises error if rebalanced value differs by >1%

### 3. Simplified Frontend Calculations (api/dashboard.py)
- **Removed**: Dynamic benchmark calculation function
- **Changed**: Dashboard now uses stored DB values
- **Result**: Consistent calculations between frontend and backend

## Expected Behavior

### Hourly Updates
- NAV calculated from actual portfolio
- Benchmark calculated from btc_units × price + eth_units × price
- Both values stored in nav_history table

### Weekly Rebalancing
- Uses current benchmark value (NOT portfolio NAV)
- Splits 50/50 and recalculates units
- Validates result within 1% tolerance
- Maintains benchmark independence

### Performance Tracking
- NAV = Actual portfolio value
- Benchmark = Hypothetical 50/50 strategy value
- Difference shows trading performance vs passive strategy

## Testing
- All systems tested and verified
- Benchmark operates independently
- Validation works correctly
- Frontend/backend consistency confirmed

## Future Enhancements
- Alpha tracking can be added in future patch
- Historical analysis tools
- Advanced performance metrics

## Status
✅ Production Ready
