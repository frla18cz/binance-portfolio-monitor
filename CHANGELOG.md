### üöÄ Usage Examples

#### Quick Start with Demo Mode
```bash
# Enable safe testing mode
export DEMO_MODE=true

# Run comprehensive demo test
python demo_test.py

# Start web dashboard
python -m api.dashboard
# Open: http://localhost:8000/dashboard
```

#### Logging System Usage
```python
from api.logger import get_logger, LogCategory, OperationTimer

logger = get_logger()

# Structured logging
logger.info(LogCategory.ACCOUNT_PROCESSING, "start_processing", 
           "Starting account processing", account_id=1, 
           data={"initial_nav": 10000.0})

# Performance timing
with OperationTimer(logger, LogCategory.API_CALL, "fetch_nav", account_id=1):
    nav = get_futures_account_nav(client)

# Get metrics
metrics = logger.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Success rate: {metrics['success_rate']:.1f}%")
```

#### Dashboard API Usage
```bash
# Get system status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/status

# Get recent logs
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/logs?limit=50&category=api_call"

# Simulate transaction (demo mode)
