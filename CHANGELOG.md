## [2025-07-20] - Transaction Type Field Migration

### üîÑ Breaking Changes
- **Database Schema**: Migrated from `transaction_type` to `type` field in `processed_transactions` table
  - Removed old `transaction_type` column completely
  - Updated all constraints and indexes to use `type` field
  - This is a one-way migration - no rollback without data loss

### üêõ Fixed
- **Field Name Inconsistency**: Fixed mismatch between saving and reading transaction types
  - Code was saving with `transaction_type` but reading `type` field
  - This caused transactions to be marked as "UNKNOWN" and not processed correctly
  - Benchmark adjustments were not applied for deposits/withdrawals

### ‚ú® Added
- **Database Migration** (`migrations/complete_type_migration.sql`)
  - Safely migrates data from `transaction_type` to `type` column
  - Adds proper constraints and indexes
  - Includes data integrity checks

- **Migration Documentation** (`docs/TRANSACTION_TYPE_MIGRATION.md`)
  - Complete migration guide and technical details
  - Rollback procedures if needed
  - Impact analysis

### üîÑ Changed
- **api/index.py**: Removed backward compatibility code for field names
- **sql/create_missing_tables.sql**: Updated schema to use `type` field with proper constraints
- **Database Constraints**: 
  - Added CHECK constraint on `type` field for valid transaction types
  - Created index `idx_processed_transactions_type` for better query performance

### üìä Impact
- **Existing Data**: All existing transactions preserved with correct type values
- **Historical Data**: PAY_WITHDRAWAL transaction from ondra(test) will remain unprocessed (already marked as processed)
- **Future Transactions**: Will be processed correctly with benchmark adjustments

### üóëÔ∏è Removed
- `transaction_type` column from `processed_transactions` table
- Old constraints: `processed_transactions_transaction_type_check`
- Old index: `idx_processed_transactions_type` (on old column)

## [2025-07-20] - Critical Fixes for Pay Transactions and Negative Benchmark

### üêõ Fixed
- **Negative Benchmark Values**: Fixed Ondra(test) account showing benchmark of -12.69 USD instead of ~1650 USD
  - Root cause: Duplicate monitoring processes running every 10 minutes
  - Each run attempted to process same Pay transactions, causing repeated benchmark adjustments
  - Solution: Implemented process lock and data cleanup

- **PAY Transaction Support**: Fixed database constraint blocking PAY_DEPOSIT and PAY_WITHDRAWAL types
  - Applied migration to extend transaction_type check constraint
  - System now properly handles Binance Pay (email/phone) transfers

- **Duplicate Processing Protection**: Added multiple layers of protection
  - Process lock prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously
  - Unique constraint on (account_id, transaction_id) ensures idempotency
  - Enhanced error handling for duplicate transaction attempts

### ‚ú® Added
- **Process Lock Utility** (`utils/process_lock.py`)
  - File-based locking mechanism with PID tracking
  - Automatic stale lock detection (1 hour timeout)
  - Prevents accidental duplicate runs

- **Full Data Cleanup** (`migrations/full_cleanup_ondra_test.sql`)
  - Complete reset script for corrupted account data
  - Removes all NAV history, transactions, and processing status
  - Resets benchmark to uninitialized state for fresh start

- **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - Transaction type validation before processing
  - Better handling of duplicate key violations
  - Improved logging for debugging

### üîÑ Changed

- `utils/process_lock.py` - New process lock utility
- `migrations/full_cleanup_ondra_test.sql` - Data cleanup script
- Database migrations applied directly to Supabase

## [2025-07-09] - Critical Bug Fixes

### üêõ Fixed
- **Rebalancing NameError**: Fixed critical bug in `rebalance_benchmark` function where undefined variable `new_eth_units` was used instead of `eth_units` (api/index.py:473)
  - This error prevented "Simple" and "Ondra(test)" accounts from processing correctly
  - "Habitanti" account was unaffected as it hadn't triggered the rebalancing code path
- **Transaction ID Length**: Increased `transaction_id` column from VARCHAR(50) to VARCHAR(255) in `processed_transactions` table
  - Fixed PostgreSQL error "value too long for type character varying(50)"
  - Some Binance transaction IDs exceed 50 characters
  - Created migration script: `sql/fix_transaction_id_length.sql`

### üöÄ Impact
- All accounts now process successfully without rebalancing errors
- Transaction processing no longer fails due to ID length constraints
- Improved system reliability and error handling

## [2025-07-09] - Log Retention Optimization

### ‚ú® Added
- **Automatic Log Cleanup**: Implemented `LogCleanupManager` for daily automated cleanup of logs older than 30 days
- **System Metadata Table**: Created `system_metadata` table to track cleanup state and prevent redundant operations
- **Cleanup Integration**: Integrated log cleanup into main monitoring process (runs after processing all accounts)

### üîÑ Changed
- **Log Retention Period**: Reduced from 365 days to 30 days for significant bandwidth and storage savings
