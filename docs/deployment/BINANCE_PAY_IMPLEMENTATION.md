# Binance Pay Transaction Detection Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Binance Pay transaction detection for email/phone transfers in the Binance Portfolio Monitor.

## Branch Information
- **Branch Name**: `fix-transaction-detection`
- **Status**: Ready for testing
- **Created**: 2025-07-19

## Problem Solved
Previously, the system could not detect internal transfers made via email or phone number through Binance Pay. These transactions were not being included in benchmark adjustments, causing incorrect portfolio performance tracking.

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Integration
Added integration with Binance Pay API endpoint:
- **Endpoint**: `/sapi/v1/pay/transactions`
- **Method**: GET
- **Authentication**: Requires API key with read permissions
- **Returns**: All Binance Pay transactions (no time limit)

### 2. New Transaction Types
Added two new transaction types:
- `PAY_DEPOSIT` - Incoming transfers via email/phone (positive amount)
- `PAY_WITHDRAWAL` - Outgoing transfers via email/phone (negative amount)

### 3. Code Changes

#### api/index.py
Enhanced `fetch_new_transactions()` function:
```python
# Fetch Binance Pay transactions (phone/email transfers)
pay_transactions = []
try:
    pay_response = binance_client._request('GET', 'sapi/v1/pay/transactions', True, {})
    if pay_response and 'data' in pay_response:
        pay_transactions = pay_response['data']
        # Filter by time and process...
```

Updated transaction processing:
```python
if txn['type'] in ['DEPOSIT', 'PAY_DEPOSIT']:
    total_net_flow += amount
elif txn['type'] in ['WITHDRAWAL', 'PAY_WITHDRAWAL']:
    total_net_flow -= amount
```

### 4. Metadata Storage
Pay transactions include detailed metadata:
```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "order_type": "C2C",
        "wallet_type": "2",
        "contact_info": {
            "name": "User-Friend",
            "email": "friend@example.com",
            "phone": "+1234567890",
            "binance_id": "38755365"
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Testing

#### Test Files Created:
1. **test_pay_transactions.py** - Tests Pay transaction detection
2. **test_mixed_transactions.py** - Tests all transaction types together

#### Test Results:
- ✅ All unit tests passed
- ✅ Edge cases handled (empty responses, errors)
- ✅ Metadata preservation verified
- ✅ Net flow calculation correct

## How to Test

### 1. Switch to the branch
```bash
git checkout fix-transaction-detection
```

### 2. Run unit tests
```bash
# Test Pay transactions only
python test_pay_transactions.py

# Test mixed transaction types
python test_mixed_transactions.py
```

### 3. Test with real account
```bash
# Run monitoring manually
python -m api.index

# Check logs for pay_transaction_detected entries
```

### 4. Verify in database
Check `processed_transactions` table for new transaction types:
```sql
SELECT transaction_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM processed_transactions 
WHERE transaction_type LIKE 'PAY_%'
GROUP BY transaction_type;
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Implementation:
- ❌ Email/phone transfers not detected
- ❌ Benchmark not adjusted for these transfers
- ❌ No visibility into internal transfers

### After Implementation:
- ✅ All email/phone transfers detected
- ✅ Benchmark properly adjusted
- ✅ Full transaction history with contact details
- ✅ Logging shows sender/receiver information

## Production Deployment

### Pre-deployment Checklist:
1. [ ] Test with production account in test environment
2. [ ] Verify API permissions (read-only sufficient)
3. [ ] Check database migration not needed (uses existing columns)
4. [ ] Monitor first run for any API rate limits

### Deployment Steps:
1. Merge to main branch
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Monitor logs for first hourly run
4. Verify new transactions in database

## Monitoring

### Success Indicators:
- Log entries: `pay_transaction_detected`
- Database records with type `PAY_DEPOSIT` or `PAY_WITHDRAWAL`
- Metadata column populated with contact info

### Error Indicators:
- Log entries: `pay_transactions_fetch_failed`
- Log entries: `pay_transaction_normalization_error`

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert to main branch
2. The system will continue working (just without Pay detection)
3. No database changes needed for rollback

## Future Enhancements
1. Add separate configuration to enable/disable Pay detection
2. Add statistics dashboard for Pay transactions
3. Add email notifications for large Pay transfers
4. Consider renaming to more descriptive types (e.g., `BINANCE_PAY_RECEIVED`)
